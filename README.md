# William

My personal home voice assistant living in my bedroom. 

# Dependecies
python-kasa
speechrecognition
pyaudio

# How it Works

Using KASA branded bulbs and plugs, it is possible to control them using the KASA api calls.
Therefore, a computer running 24/7 will need to be active to run the python script in this repo.
Prefferably a single board computer (SBC) running the script using linux would be best although any
computer will work.
After installing the dependecies required for William to work, William will require a microphone to listen
to any incoming audio. For this, I personaly used an old andriod phone and used VLC to pick up the audio the
phone was listening to.


# Features

William here can turn off and on any Kasa device according to how are named
William can change the colors, brightness, and temperature of any programmed lightbulb.

# Warning

a much more powerful and capable home assistant that be easily used to control Kasa devices
